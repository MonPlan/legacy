AHT2712,Curating: Histories and theories,ada," This unit will offer students an introduction to the most important and influential theories of curating and provide an overview of the history of curating from the mid-18th century on. Although the unit will focus on curating insofar as it involves art objects, it will also point to both historical instances of curation that did not involve art objects (eg. Wunderkammers) and present-day instances of curating where the term has become virtually synonymous with any act of selection (music, photographs, food). The overall aim of the unit is provide students with a working vocabulary so that they can ask critical questions of the contemporary practice of curation.Lectures will largely provide a chronological history of curation, starting with early museums and collections, but with an emphasis on the rise of curating and the figure of the curator from the mid-1970s on. A number of key instances of curation (particular exhibitions and international Biennales and Triennials) will be selected for particular analysis. In this way, students will be given both an overall history of art curation and a way of thinking the term's almost infinite expansion in the present. The overall aim of the unit is to provide students with an appropriate working method for any curation they might undertake in the future and a way of thinking about issues of curation if they choose to work in a museum or write about art. In some ways, the unit is intended as a preliminary to the more practice-based unit Curating: Practice, although this is not its only possible outcome.","12 credit points at first year level in Art History & Theory, or Theory of Art & Design, or Visual Culture, or permission from the Unit Coordinator",AHT3712
AHT2722,Curating: Practices,ada,"Curating: Practices is intended as a complement to Curating: Histories and Theories (although the units may be taken in any order). In this unit, students are encouraged to plan and execute one or several acts of curation. Following the practice of contemporary curation, these acts of curation need not necessarily involve works of art. Students may curate photographs, their hobbies, pieces of art writing, their own objects or those of others. However, the emphasis will be on the final ""public"" (whether in reality or using such technologies as the internet) exhibition of such curation and the student's ability to explain and justify this curation. Students will work with their lecturer throughout the semester to develop this exhibition/series of exhibitions. Classes will consist of 3-hour long seminars in which the lecturer works with the students, and the students along with the lecturer will hold ""crit"" sessions in which proposed and upcoming exhibitions are discussed and workshopped. As in art-making classes, an end-of-class overall exhibition will be planned, and part of the unit will require students (along with the lecturer) to plan how such an overall exhibition of exhibitions might be conceived, planned and brought to practical realisation. It is even possible that in the medium term, this unit will become responsible for a number of end-of-year and end-of-semester exhibitions around the campus.","12 credit points at first year level in Art History & Theory, or Theory of Art & Design, or Visual Culture, or permission from the Unit Coordinator",AHT3722

It focuses on a historical lineage of art's mediums and disciplines and how they are framed, constituted and judged in a diverse range of academic fields. Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art's form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms. The unit introduces key theoretical tenets to analyse late modernist and contemporary art practices as case studies.

AHT3712,Curating: Histories and theories,ada," This unit will offer students an introduction to the most important and influential theories of curating and provide an overview of the history of curating from the mid-18th century on. Although the unit will focus on curating insofar as it involves art objects, it will also point to both historical instances of curation that did not involve art objects (eg. Wunderkammers) and present-day instances of curating where the term has become virtually synonymous with any act of selection (music, photographs, food). The overall aim of the unit is provide students with a working vocabulary so that they can ask critical questions of the contemporary practice of curation.Lectures will largely provide a chronological history of curation, starting with early museums and collections, but with an emphasis on the rise of curating and the figure of the curator from the mid-1970s on. A number of key instances of curation (particular exhibitions and international Biennales and Triennials) will be selected for particular analysis. In this way, students will be given both an overall history of art curation and a way of thinking the term's almost infinite expansion in the present. The overall aim of the unit is to provide students with an appropriate working method for any curation they might undertake in the future and a way of thinking about issues of curation if they choose to work in a museum or write about art. In some ways, the unit is intended as a preliminary to the more practice-based unit Curating: Practice, although this is not its only possible outcome.","12 credit points at first year level in Art History & Theory, or Theory of Art & Design, or Visual Culture, or permission from the Unit Coordinator",AHT2712
AHT3722,Curating: Practices,ada,"Curating: Practices is intended as a complement to Curating: Histories and Theories (although the units may be taken in any order). In this unit, students are encouraged to plan and execute one or several acts of curation. Following the practice of contemporary curation, these acts of curation need not necessarily involve works of art. Students may curate photographs, their hobbies, pieces of art writing, their own objects or those of others. However, the emphasis will be on the final ""public"" (whether in reality or using such technologies as the internet) exhibition of such curation and the student's ability to explain and justify this curation. Students will work with their lecturer throughout the semester to develop this exhibition/series of exhibitions. Classes will consist of 3-hour long seminars in which the lecturer works with the students, and the students along with the lecturer will hold ""crit"" sessions in which proposed and upcoming exhibitions are discussed and workshopped. As in art-making classes, an end-of-class overall exhibition will be planned, and part of the unit will require students (along with the lecturer) to plan how such an overall exhibition of exhibitions might be conceived, planned and brought to practical realisation. It is even possible that in the medium term, this unit will become responsible for a number of end-of-year and end-of-semester exhibitions around the campus.","12 credit points at first year level in Art History & Theory, or Theory of Art & Design, or Visual Culture, or permission from the Unit Coordinator",AHT2722

Such questions will be posed in terms of the political and ideological context of the time: broadly, the gradual but alarming transformation of a static feudal hierarchy into the fluid social order of capitalism, and the challenges posed by (some) women to the limiting assumptions of institutionalized patriarchy.The unit raises fundamental questions such as: What are we looking for in the texts we read? Can we, or should we, use literature to understand what authors and their contemporary readers thought about an issue: using literary texts as sociological and historical artefacts? Or should we, or do we, read an ever-widening circle of texts as an exercise in pleasure-seeking, or as a way of looking for a universal truth about the human condition, or the nature of truth or beauty?Students will be encouraged to consider these question via a series of self-guided explorations of literature from the past, relating texts they have chosen to a corpus of contemporary literature.","Two gateway units in Literary studies, or permission from the unit coordinator.",

Students explore such critical issues as notions of nationhood and 'race,' cosmopolitanism, immigration and exile, gender and subjectivity, and the confrontation of modernity with tradition. As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space.

The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012.  Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently.  In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened.  This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance.",Twelve credit points of second-year Arts units.

ATS4328,Grand theories of politics and international relations,arts,"This unit investigates the concept of 'the political' in modern and contemporary political theory. In the late twentieth century key Western European and American thinkers and government advisors claimed that humanity had arrived at the end of history.

Many contemporary political theorists challenge this 'post-political' consensus. In doing so they draw on grand theories of politics to develop a range of concepts of 'the political'. This unit aims to examine these different discourses and concepts of 'the political' and to assess their significance for contemporary political questions regarding justice, citizenship and recognition in a globalised, post-Westphalian world.

It investigates what species are, how to recognise them, how they are described and classified, and the range of circumstances and mechanisms under which they form in nature. Armed with this background, we investigate the evolution of the key biological phenomena of relevance to ecology, notably life-history evolution. The unit goes on to explore the genetic basis of evolution by natural selection and adaptation of organisms to their environments. This entails an appreciation of the control and inheritance of traits that have major influences in the lives of organisms, and fundamental evolutionary principles and approaches (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, fitness, adaptive genetic variation, heritability of complex traits and their response to natural selection). Students will understand how different kinds of genetic variation are (and are not) associated with fitness of individual organisms and viability of populations. We then explore approaches to investigating population biology of organisms (such as estimating dispersal and gene flow in real landscapes) in a coherent progression encompassing small and large ecological scales. These concepts are illustrated by exploration of exciting examples encompassing pure and applied science, including urban ecology, invasion and conservation biology, global change ecology, with associated practical work. We examine fitness in natural populations and the special issues of small populations, particularly inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variation, limits to adaptation to new environmental pressures, and the relationship between genetic variation and extinction risk of populations and species. We investigate how genetic variation in organisms is associated with ecosystem function, ecological community structure and protection against environmental change.

EAE2522,Sediments and basins,sci,"Geologists study our Earth by digging through millions (and even billions) of years into the 'deep time' past.  Older interpretations have been integrated with bold, new insights into a grand scenario of a dynamic planet 'on the move'.   Continents break apart and reassemble; ocean floors open up and deepen into grand basins; volcanoes blow their tops; and even huge mountains systems rise up from originally quiet seas, a seemingly perpetual pageant of dynamic geologic processes. By studying and surveying global basins and their diverse infill of sediments and associated fossils, we can piece together the grand geologic puzzle through the ages.  Fossil remains assist greatly in reconstructing ancient global continental connections, environments and climate, punctuated by global catastrophes to arrive at a picture of the evolution of life through time.  This 'big picture science' is accomplished by diverse disciplines, including tectonics, sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology, geophysics, and field work, the latter of which is a significant skills set for the geologist.   Ultimately, we endeavour to reconstruct our great earth jigsaw through the ages and in the modern age use the rock record of basins for global energy needs (i.e., water, oil, gas, and coal). In doing so, we enrich humanity by peering into unfamiliar and previously unknown ancient environments around the globe and by supplying important resources.","One of EAE1011, EAC1022, ESC1011, ESC1022 or ENG1002",ESC2111

EDF2161,Numeracy and mathematics for learning and life,edu,"This unit addresses the key questions of what the similarities and distinctions are between numeracy and mathematics. Although numeracy is sometimes thought of as a subset of mathematics, it can also be seen as encompassing a different set of aims and objectives. For example, the power of 'pure' mathematics can be thought of as resting in the pleasure that mathematicians gain from 'playing' with mathematics for its own sake, and the resultant ever more abstract nature of the subject. In contrast, being numerate means working in the opposite direction: looking for the mathematics potentially 'hidden' in the world and drawing on quantitative skills to question particular issues. Numeracy is linked to being able to make critically informed judgements, judgements for which mathematical knowledge in itself may not equip one. By addressing such issues the unit develops both students' understanding of numeracy and mathematics and what this means for them as teachers and future leaders of numeracy in schools.",EDF1161,

EDF5693,Using and evaluating research evidence,edu,"This unit focuses on the challenges and opportunities of using and evaluating research evidence in professional practice. Calls for evidence-based policy and practice have become increasingly widespread across many areas of public policy. Within education, there is increasing emphasis on the need for research evidence to be used in the improvement of educational practice and the development of educational policy. But what is research evidence and where can it be accessed? How can different kinds of research evidence be evaluated critically and applied to practice and policy? What skills and processes are involved in using research evidence to solve problems, make decisions and lead change? And what is behind the growth of evidence-based agendas within and beyond education? Through exploration of each of the above questions, students develop their skills in identifying, distinguishing and appraising different kinds of research evidence. Drawing on different models and approaches to research use, they gain experience analysing, using and communicating research evidence in relation to a specific concern of relevance to their professional or educational contexts.

LAW4247,Current issues in statutory interpretation,law," The first half of the unit will consist of an in-depth consideration of the main theories of statutory interpretation:  intentionalism, textualism and purposivism.  With regard to intentionalism, the focus will not only be on the standard arguments for and against intentionalism, but also on the deeper theoretical commitments of intentionalism.  For example, intentionalism presupposes that there is a defensible notion of legislative intent.  Students will consider not only classic (aggregative) theories of legislative intent, and the criticisms of those theories, but also contemporary (largely non-aggregative) theories.  Students will also consider the current scepticism among judges on the High Court of Australia towards the concept of legislative intent.  Similarly, with regard to textualism, consideration will be given not only to the standard arguments for and against textualism, but also to different versions of textualism based on different accounts of the meaning of a legal text.  Consideration will also be given to Andrei Marmor's recent argument that, while textualism provides an accurate account of the meaning of statutory texts, few appellate court cases involving statutory interpretation turn on a correct understanding of the meaning of the relevant statutory text.The second half of the unit will turn from theory to practice, with an in-depth consideration of the High Court of Australia's current approach to statutory interpretation and some criticisms of that approach.  Students will consider the role that constitutional principles governing the distinction between judicial and legislative power affect the way in which judges interpret statutes, the general approach that judges take to statutory interpretation and the account of the linguistic content of statutes implicitly accepted by the High Court.  Consideration will also be given to the role that the principle of legality plays in the interpretation of statutes, and cases where the legal effect of a statute may differ from its linguistic content (where, for example, that linguistic content is ambiguous or where there is a need for equitable interpretation).  Critical attention will focus on the High Court's understanding of the difference between legislative and judicial power, and its understanding of the relationship between the linguistic content of a statute and the legal effect of that statute.",LAW1101 and LAW1104 (or equivalent from another institution),
LAW4249,"Environmental activism, ecoterrorism and the law",law," This subject is designed to provide both a comprehensive and critical introduction to global ecoterrorism.

In doing so, the Unit will examine sport in its various guises, local, national and international; professional and amateur; contact and non-contact; and explore sports' social, cultural, economic and political importance.  Next, the Unit explores the extent to which sport's '""specificity"" (its unique social and cultural standing and need for ""competitive balance"") has seen legislatures and courts modify the application to it of traditional legal concepts. Areas to be examined include the application of criminal law to on-field violence; tort and OHS law to sports related injuries; contract and employment law to sports persons' employment contracts and collective bargaining agreements; competition, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination law to the rules and practices by which sporting competitions are organised and conducted; and privacy, intellectual property, discrimination and other laws to protect a sports person's name, image, likeness and other attributes of their identity or person. The Unit then explores the development of unique legal rules and institutions tailored to sports persons and sporting activities, and the extent to which they are amenable to state regulatory and judicial systems.  These include sport specific self-regulating governance and dispute resolution systems; anti-drug codes; and rules concerning gambling and match-fixing. The Unit's focus is on domestic Australian law, but with an eye to how emerging commercial arrangements and legal doctrines in the US and EU could influence the law in Australia.

The course will begin by studying the principles underlying compensation before moving to restitution, punishment and coercion. While it will not be possible to look at every general law remedy, the major topics concerning the assessment of damages in tort and contract, misleading or deceptive conduct and for breach of equitable obligations will be studied.Among the questions to be considered are: With compensatory damages being the primary remedy for many torts and for breach of contract, what role is there for punishment and gain-based damages in our law of civil obligations and what remedies give effect to these goals? Why are the compensation rules for tort different from those for contract? How are they different? How do the doctrine of mitigation and other limiting factors affect compensation in common law? In what ways does the assessment of damages for misleading or deceptive conduct differ from damages in tort and contract? Is compensation assessed differently where there is a breach of an equitable obligation? Should it be?

LAW4528,Comparative consumer bankruptcy,law,"The 'democratization of credit' refers to the recent expansion in access to credit by households in the lower ranges of the distribution of income. A major policy question raised by the democratization of credit is how to adapt consumer bankruptcy law and parallel out-of-court measures to the increased incidence of over indebtedness. As the recent sub prime crisis highlights, common law systems have generally taken a laissez-faire approach and used the bankruptcy system as the primary legal remedy when debtors cannot repay their loans. This unit will deal with the approaches taken in a number of jurisdictions, including Europe and North America, to address the policy questions raised by the democratization of credit in recent years. Among the subjects considered are: out of court and formal bankruptcy procedures, consensual negotiation, creditor responsibility and the historical trajectory of regulatory approaches to over indebtedness.",,
LAW4531,Product liability law from a comparative perspective,law," Product Liability refers to civil liability for injuries caused by defective products. This class will focus mainly on two systems of addressing injuries from defective products the American law system and the European Union system.Product liability occupies a central role in American law, as the number of new products used by consumers has increased exponentially. With this proliferation of new consumer products has come an increase in injuries. Products liability is a major way America attempts to deter firms from manufacturing unsafe products, and to compensate those that suffer injury from those products.The first part of the course will examine the American product liability system, focusing on the key sources of law underlying that system--common law principles of negligence, strict liability and deceit, contract and warranty principles, and statutory principles found in the Uniform Commercial Code. Using these sources of law, the course will explore the main theories of manufacturer liability, the concept of product defect, and defences available to the manufacturer under American law.The second part of the course will explore the same issues from the EU perspective. The European Community adopted its first Product Liability Directive in 1985, and its version of strict products liability has since been adopted in some version in many parts of the world. The EU approach differs in many important ways from the American approach. For example, the EU directive focuses on a test for defect the consumer expectation test that has been abandoned or given less significance in most American jurisdictions. The two systems like wise differ in their respective approaches to proof, remedies, defences, and defining a proper defendant. Moreover, unlike the American system, where product liability dominates the system of accident compensation, in most European countries, product liability plays a more modest role, and acts more as a supplement to the social compensation systems available in those countries.Why have the two systems evolved in such different ways? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches? Those are the core issues that the course will address.",LAW2101 Contract A and LAW2102 Contract B and LAW2201 Torts A and LAW2202 Torts B or an equivalent Introductory course in tort law and contract law at another university.,

LAW4534,Law and biology,law," Rules aim to create order in our society. They provide structure so people know how to behave and what to expect from others. Rules are devised by people. Biologically, people are creatures that live in groups and need groups. Rules are needed to maintain group stability. Law, therefore, is in essence a biological phenomenon that can, and indeed should, be studied in the light of biological theories. In addition, because modern biology cannot be comprehended without evolutionary processes, evolutionary biology is one of the perspectives that can increase our understanding of the principles of law. To be sure, we should be careful in applying biological mechanisms to legal subjects, yet we may more fully grasp the nature of law by bringing the two disciplines together.It is currently also difficult to use evolutionary biology to determine which legal incentives should be used to regulate behaviour, not least because we do not exactly know to what end we should regulate behaviour. However, these caveats do not imply that law cannot be seen as a kind of extended phenotype that can be studied by biologists.  With the right genes, an organism can build a shelter, thereby improving not only its survival chances but also the replication chances of its genes. It is reasonable to assume that people have the right genes to build a law system that maximises their survival chances.However, will this confuse the is with the ought? In philosophy, it is taboo to derive norms from facts. In the context of law and biology, however, this seems odd as connecting these disciplines is very much about linking the ought and the is. Where biology can give us credible foundations for law, there necessarily has to be a connection between is and ought. Moreover, we should ask ourselves whether there even is a substantial difference between the two notions. Could we not regard the ought as a particular type of is?From this point of view, morals and rules are a product of our brain, as are all interpretations of facts. The brain in its turn is also a product of genes and environment.When law is studied from a biological perspective, then questions should be asked about the rationality of law. How can a judge take a strictly rational decision when our thinking is closely linked with emotion and feelings? Can the gap between legal professionals and ordinary citizens be partly explained because jurists do not ask themselves whether lawfulness includes a sense of justice?In this course we will study biological and psychological backgrounds of the law. This may not always be easy, because several of our certainties may prove to be illusory or ill-founded. Asking questions about the biological foundations of law involves questioning our own identity. In that sense, science is ruthless;  dogmas must and will be questioned.Can biology and psychology give all the answers? Certainly not. Nevertheless, it is important to think implications over. As Mill said: Maybe the opinion is true, or maybe is contains a portion of truth an even there is no truth in it at all, then it still sharpens our own conviction.In this course we will explore some biological and psychological facts and we will ask ourselves questions like: Can biology usefully contribute to moral argument? Can it contribute to an understanding of the proper role and functioning of legal norms?The lecturer published articles in which he states that the ought can be derived from the biological is. Nevertheless, he explicitly challenges his students to falsify this statement. In this way students can explore the issues and form their own views.",,

Consequently, in relation to international law, it will examine the trade mark aspects of the TRIPS agreement (including consideration of geographical indications) and the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of ICANN relating to domain names. To a lesser extent, deal with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Madrid Protocol relating to multiple filings of trade mark applications. Selected, key aspects of comparison will include issues such as jurisdiction specific approaches to ownership, the requirements for registrability of trade marks such as shape trade marks and the different approaches to infringement, including dilution of trade marks and parallel importing. Other topics may include the registration and control of domain names.

Topical issues touching on how domestic law interacts with legal diversity in family law will be canvassed. Particular emphasis will be placed on the interactions between religiously-governed family law and secular state law.From the comparative law perspective, the course will progress to a consideration of the ways in which Immigration and Refugee Law interacts with domestic family law and family law policy.The seminar will then progress to an examination of the traditional common law conflict of law principles that touch on family law matters, including jurisdiction and recognition and international enforcement of foreign family law orders. Consideration will then be given to the modification of the common law regime by treaty and legislation, including the various Hague Conventions that apply to family law issues. Further attention will be given to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as other human rights treaties. Each regime will be considered in the context of its impact upon domestic legal issues.The six main area of family law will be examined through the lenses of comparative and international law, including marriage, divorce, matrimonial property, adoption, custody, and support.",,
LAW4537,"Public policy, regulation and the law",law,"This Unit explores the interrelationship between public policy, regulation and the law.  The Unit begins by introducing students to the policy cycle - the process by which issues (or problems) are identified and prioritised for action by government, and the action to be taken to address the issue (solve the problem) is agreed. In doing so, the Unit will expose students to some of the challenges facing governments and regulators when deciding whether and how to address a particular issue. The Unit also will introduce students to the breadth of tools available to governments to achieve their policy ends. In doing so, the Unit will explore how the concept of 'regulation' has expanded beyond the traditional legal concept of regulation as rules promulgated by a sovereign state, to include all the tools used by governments and other actors to alter or control the behaviour of people and other entities. The Unit will then explore some the theories, concepts and constructs that explain regulatory practice in a modern liberal capitalist society, before moving on to consider what may constitute 'good' regulation and regulatory practice. Finally, the Unit will explore how the law intersects with, supports and shapes public policy and the regulatory endeavour. Rather than focus on one substantive area of regulation, several case studies will be used to illustrate and highlight the general themes of the Unit. Moreover, the Unit will include aspects of politics, economics, public administration and public policy in its consideration of the issues, further developing students' skills in understanding and applying the law in its societal context.", For students who commenced their LLB (Hons) course in 2015 or later:LAW1111; LAW1114; LAW1112; LAW1113; LAW2101; LAW2102; LAW2112; LAW2111For students who commenced their LLB course prior to 2015:LAW1100 OR LAW1101 and LAW1102 or LAW1104,None
LAW4538,"Lawyers, literature and cinema",law," The representation of Law and lawyers within popular culture is one of the most important, but underappreciated, dimensions of the legal profession, of practice, and of the practical negotiation of legal ethics. The 'social status' of the lawyer within the wider culture is one of the dominant factors governing the student's decision to enter (or not to enter) law school. Furthermore, the dissemination of judicial procedure and dispute resolution through popular culture and the mass media is one of the primary means of both enforcing and challenging the legitimacy of Law and its practitioners within the broader community.Within the diverse representations of Law offered by popular culture both literature and cinema are of special significance. Literature, both 'elitist' (Kafka; Camus) and 'popular' (Thurow; Grisham) is one of the primary mediums for the critical examination of legal reasoning and the nature and ethics of practice within the wider culture, often revealing subversive and confronting truths normally suppressed by conventional legal education and training. Cinema, along with television, is one of the leading arenas for the formulation of the social consensus concerning the nature of Law and lawyers, often artistically re-staging the processes of legal reasoning and dispute resolution so as to both critique and affirm the legitimacy of legal culture.This unit will examine all of these issues through a critical analysis and discussion of a number of the seminal 'texts' within both the literature and cinema of Law.", LAW1101LAW1104,None
LAW4539,Modern constitutionalism: A comparative perspective,law," In the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that the age of parliamentary democracy had passed and that the concept of constitutional democracy had swept the world. Yet, closer study reveals that the picture is not uniform. First, substantively different versions of the constitutional model may be identified. Second, it is already possible to see the first signs of a shift to a stage of synthesis in which a new constitutional model is being generated which integrates the principle of the supremacy of the legislature with that of the supremacy of the judiciary.This course will concentrate on presenting various constitutional models and examining their advantages and disadvantages. The course will be divided into three parts. In the first part we shall describe the 'traditional constitutional model' and its underlying rationale. In addition, we shall distinguish between various versions of this model and illustrate them by describing and comparing the constitutional mechanism in a number of countries (United States, Germany, France and Italy). In the second part, we shall examine several arguments against the traditional constitutional model and various proposals made to resolve those argument. In the third part, we shall describe the 'synthesized model', explain its rationale and illustrate it by describing the constitutional mechanism in a number of countries which have apparently adopted it (Canada, New Zealand and Great Britain).",,

LAW4677,International information and media law,law," Information and media content are potentially ubiquitous, whereas regulation, culture and context are generally not. This makes conflicts between different regulatory schemes inevitable. The conventional legal solutions of resolving jurisdictional conflicts, which have been designed for an offline world, are not sufficient to deal with the problems of the information age. The unit will survey the legal and regulatory approaches currently operating to resolve conflicts in the global exchange of information and media content. The different legal domestic approaches, and their interrelationship with emerging regional governance structures, will be critically examined.In the first part, the existing concepts of conflicts of law will be analysed and specific approaches (cyber law, setting of international standards, global media governance etc.) will be discussed, including the international institutions (WRC, ITU, ICANN) and dispute resolution fori (WTO, WIPO).The second part of the unit will explore the human rights context. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and of the media generally, can clash with other human rights such as privacy, data protection, and personality rights. Even though human rights are universal, the way conflicting human rights are balanced will reflect the cultural context and diversity of legal systems.The third part will shift the focus to the media and information industry. Media content and information must also be seen from a business perspective and, when disseminated across borders, have regard to international business law. Intellectual property and international trade agreements are important levers for the protection of local culture and other domestic interests.The fourth and final part will deal with information-related crimes, such as copyright violations, propaganda, pornography and child abuse, as well as with information warfare."," For students who commenced their LLB course prior to 2015:LAW1101 Introduction to legal reasoning and LAW1104 Research and writingFor students enrolled in the LLB (Honours) course from 2015:LAW1111 Foundations of law, LAW1112 Public law and statutory interpretation, LAW1113 Torts, LAW1114 Criminal law 1, LAW2101 Contract A, LAW2102 Contract B, LAW2111 Constitutional law and LAW2112 Property AFor other students:Equivalent introductory units from another university",

LAW4681,Global economic law,law,"The rapidly increasing rate of globalisation of economic activity over the past few decades has dramatically altered the nature and dimensions of global economic transactions and engagement. It has also challenged the capacities of national governments to regulate economic activity within their domestic domains.The post-World War II trading rules (including GATT), along with the lower cost of international transport and the advent of the internet have facilitated the rapid growth of global economic activity, and the growth of international corporate behemoths. This has brought about substantial economic benefits to many, and assisted with lifting millions of people out of poverty. However, this has come at the expense of lowered competition through the growth of global monopolists (or near monopolists), the exploitation of labour and the environment, and increased tax and regulatory evasion, as national governments struggle to regulate cross-border activities. These trends are placing strains on domestic consensus about the benefits of economic globalisation, which is evident in the rise of nationalistic movements in various countries, including those in developed countries.This unit engages students in critical discussion and evaluations about the nature and form of these developments, the key global arrangements and institutions involved, the costs and benefits of these developments, and ways in which reforms could be undertaken.Students will actively engage in analysis and debate about: global trading arrangements and institutions (GATT, WTO and free trade agreements); global financing arrangements and institutions (IMF, Bank of International Settlements, and the resolution of international investment disputes settlements - the ICSID); the possibilities for global regulation of the exploitation of labour and the environment and access to medicines; and global policy making institutions and organisations, including the G20, OECD, UNCTAD, UNCITRAL, Davos and NGOs.", For students who commenced their LLB (Hons) prior to 2015:LAW1101; LAW1104For students who commenced their LLB (Hons) course in 2015 or later:LAW1111; LAW1114; LAW1112; LAW1113; LAW2101; LAW2102; LAW2112; LAW2111,LAW5392 - Globalisation and international economic law

LAW5427,Freedom of speech: Law theory and policy,law," This subject is divided into three main parts. In the first part, an examination will be made of what are said to be the philosophical underpinnings of the notion of freedom of speech. Those underpinnings will be critically assessed, and their limitations, with regard to particular forms of speech, analysed. In this part of the course consideration will also be given to what we should appropriately regard as constituting ""speech"" in the context of freedom of speech - for instance, should the wearing of religious adornments count as ""speech"" for the purposes of freedom of speech? Consideration will be given, too, to what is appropriately understood by ""freedom"" in the context of freedom of speech and what such freedom requires - for example, in order for there to be ""freedom of speech"" in the requisite sense, is it necessary that there be laws positively enabling speech? Or is it sufficient simply that there be no laws prohibiting or limiting speech?In the second part of the course, an examination will first of all be made of Australia's obligations, pursuant to international law, with regard to the provision of freedom of speech. Then, consideration will be given to the protections actually afforded to freedom of speech both in Australia and overseas. In an Australian context, in-depth consideration will be given to the implied freedom of political communication contained in the Australian Constitution and to the so-called principle of ""legality"", used in statutory interpretation to limit the circumstances in which statutory power can infringe upon fundamental rights (including freedom of speech). Consideration will also be given to the relevant provisions of the Victorian Charter.In an overseas context, students will be provided with an overview of the protection afforded to freedom of speech in the United States, Canada and the European Community. Comparisons will be drawn with the protection afforded in Australia.In the third part of the course - which will occupy about half of the course - in-depth consideration will be given to various Australian legal regimes that prohibit, restrict or otherwise regulate certain kinds of speech (and which, therefore, restrict or regulate freedom of speech).

LAW5449,Advanced administrative law,law," Administrative law determines what governments can and cannot do.  It is a dynamic and rapidly changing area of law and practice. This unit will enable students to understand key issues affecting contemporary administrative law, how and why the law is changing, and what those changes might bring.The unit will cover three key contemporary questions in administrative law.  The first is whether and how public law does and should take account of commercial issues.  This part of the course will ask whether administrative law remedies such as judicial review should apply to private sector bodies that perform ""quasi-public"" functions.  It will also consider whether judicial review and other administrative law remedies should apply, or be modified, to government decisions that could be regulated by other commercial law principles. Should judicial review apply to government tendering decisions?  Are notions of ""commercial in confidence"" a sound reason to withhold details about government contracts from the public?  Should companies have standing in administrative law to challenge government decisions which benefit competing companies?The second key issue the course will consider is whether the courts are always the best forum to challenge government decisions.  Public law remedies traditionally involve one party who challenges a single decision, but many decisions are ""polycentric"" because they raise many issues and affect many people.  This part of course will examine those ""polycentric decisions"", such as planning and revenue decisions, and consider why some decisions are less suited for review by courts and tribunals than are other decisions that are not polycentric (or, at least not polycentric to such an extent).  It will also compare the position in Australia with that in England where the courts have developed legal principles to regulate public consultation.The third issue the course will consider concerns national security - how, when and why issues of national security can affect administrative law review?  This problem has emerged as governments in Australia and other common law jurisdictions have sought to limit the rights of people to challenge decisions, or receive information, in cases involving national security.  This part of the course will examine those decisions in Australia where normal rights of review by the courts or tribunals are limited for reasons of national security.  This part of the course will also consider when and how the Australian Constitution might require a minimum level of fairness in such cases.",LAW5014,

The first is intestacy (when a person dies without a valid will) and will making. This part of the course examines the presumptive distribution of assets in intestacy and the novel Victorian approach. It also examines the execution requirements for will making and the process to grant probate to wills and codicils that do not meet those requirements.The second key issue of the course is the doctrines affecting testamentary gifts. What can and cannot be done through the gift clauses? This part of the course examines the nature and  limits of ""testamentary freedom"" (the ability of people to dispose of their estate as they wish).A key such limit is ""family provision"", under which close relative and partners of a deceased person can challenge the distribution of an estate.The third part of the course examines managing and distributing deceased estates.  This includes the standards for those managing an estate, control of funeral and burial arrangements and when and how can beneficiaries challenge or remove a personal representative.The final part of the course examines professional obligations of lawyers.

LAW5609,Law and liberty,law,"The aim of this course is to consider the meaning of political liberty in Europe, US and Australia today. It will examine the theoretical underpinnings of many areas of human rights, such as free speech, privacy and political rights. To do so it will compare different traditions of Western thought that continue to influence our views on liberty. The course is based upon close readings of selected politico-legal philosophers, for example John Stuart Mill's ""On Liberty"", which argues for freedom of speech and action to the extent that this freedom is consistent with not harming others. Liberal and republican views of political freedom are contrasted, along with Kant's analysis that provides the theoretical underpinning of many arguments for human rights. While the course is structured around an examination of primary philosophical readings, the theoretical frameworks will be considered in the context of contemporary legal debates and concepts.",,
LAW5610,"Varieties of the secular: Law, religion, and social change",law,"This seminar will provide both an historical and contemporary comparative look at the ways that legal systems have dealt with religious difference, freedom of religion, and ""the secular"". An important note in contemporary scholarship on the contemporary interaction of law and religion has been that there is not a single ""secular"" but, rather, varieties of secularisms. A close study of the various ways that political power, law, and religion have been configured provides a unique and valuable line of sight into comparative legal traditions, constitutional structure, and legal and political theory. Some of the most interesting contemporary legal and political debates have arisen out of questions about freedom of religion, its limits, and the just relationship between religion and the state.",,

LAW5631,"Lawyers, literature and cinema",law," The representation of Law and lawyers within popular culture is one of the most important, but underappreciated, dimensions of the legal profession, of practice, and of the practical negotiation of legal ethics. The 'social status' of the lawyer within the wider culture is one of the dominant factors governing the student's decision to enter (or not to enter) law school. Furthermore, the dissemination of judicial procedure and dispute resolution through popular culture and the mass media is one of the primary means of both enforcing and challenging the legitimacy of Law and its practitioners within the broader community.Within the diverse representations of Law offered by popular culture both literature and cinema are of special significance. Literature, both 'elitist' (Kafka; Camus) and 'popular' (Thurow; Grisham) is one of the primary mediums for the critical examination of legal reasoning and the nature and ethics of practice within the wider culture, often revealing subversive and confronting truths normally suppressed by conventional legal education and training. Cinema, along with television, is one of the leading arenas for the formulation of the social consensus concerning the nature of Law and lawyers, often artistically re-staging the processes of legal reasoning and dispute resolution so as to both critique and affirm the legitimacy of legal culture.This unit will examine all of these issues through a critical analysis and discussion of a number of the seminal 'texts' within both the literature and cinema of Law.",LAW7470/LAW5000 or LAW7212/LAW5080,
LAW5632,International information and media law,law," Information and media content are potentially ubiquitous, whereas regulation, culture and context are generally not. This makes conflicts between different regulatory schemes inevitable. The conventional legal solutions of resolving jurisdictional conflicts, which have been designed for an offline world, are not sufficient to deal with the problems of the information age. The unit will survey the legal and regulatory approaches currently operating to resolve conflicts in the global exchange of information and media content. The different legal domestic approaches, and their interrelationship with emerging regional governance structures, will be critically examined.In the first part, the existing concepts of conflicts of law will be analysed and specific approaches (cyber law, setting of international standards, global media governance etc.) will be discussed, including the international institutions (WRC, ITU, ICANN) and dispute resolution fori (WTO, WIPO).The second part of the unit will explore the human rights context. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and of the media generally, can clash with other human rights such as privacy, data protection, and personality rights. Even though human rights are universal, the way conflicting human rights are balanced will reflect the cultural context and diversity of legal systems.The third part will shift the focus to the media and information industry. Media content and information must also be seen from a business perspective and, when disseminated across borders, have regard to international business law. Intellectual property and international trade agreements are important levers for the protection of local culture and other domestic interests.The fourth and final part will deal with information-related crimes, such as copyright violations, propaganda, pornography and child abuse, as well as with information warfare.",,

Theoretical knowledge will include pathophysiology, technology, evidence and practice issues related to skills clusters. These clusters include: Prenatal, Perinatal, Postnatal and High Risk.Opportunities will be given for students to participate in an inter-professional workshop with medical students to acquire some complex clinical skills. Students will understand the requirement and processes necessary for evidence based practice and will gain skills for its implementation in an environment that might be resistant.

PHY2011,"Neuroscience of communication, sensory and control systems",sci,"This unit studies how the cells in our body communicate to each other, using fast and slow response systems, and how our bodies use these systems to gain information about the world through our senses and then respond using the muscle systems of our limbs and internal organs and the hormone systems. This material is taught through four successive themes that progressively build up the discipline knowledge and broader organisation, communication and management skills of science. Themes 1 and 2 (Foundations) explain cell structure and nerve organisation and function. Theme 3 (Communication systems) develops that knowledge base to study fast and slow inter-cell communication systems. Theme 4 (Sensory systems) shows how the systems of touch, pain, hearing, vision, taste and smell detect the world and how the brain analyses that information. Theme 5 (Control and response systems) details how the body responds through movement of limbs and the action of internal organs, and hormone systems.
